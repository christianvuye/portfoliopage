        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>Hi there!</h3>

        <p>
          I'm a <strong> Junior Python developer </strong> with a background in
          game development. My first programming experience was when I worked as
          a technical designer scripting the mission flow for a Fast and Furious
          Crossroads level.<br /><br />

          Later, I moved towards managerial roles, managing 20-30 people using
          agile frameworks such as <strong>Scrum and Kanban</strong>. As this
          role depended on repetitive, manual tasks, I developed tools to
          automate and improve these processes. <br /><br />

          I also founded VMC Fitness, a fitness company that provides
          English-speaking clients in Valencia with the highest quality
          evidence-based service.<br /><br />

          I bootstrapped the company out of my apartment with little to no
          starting capital, and after ten months, its market value was â‚¬33,000.
          I eventually decided to sell complete ownership of the company to
          return to programming.<br /><br />

          I am currently developing my skills for creating
          <strong>web apps within the Django framework.</strong> I want to
          <strong
            >explore Python further for Data Science, Machine Learning, and
            Artificial Intelligence</strong
          >
          applications in the future.<br /><br />

          Irrespective of the industry or field that I am in, I am a passionate,
          hard-working, and incredibly curious individual with a relentless work
          ethic. <br /><br />

          I thrive under pressure, am a pro-active fast learner with strong
          communication skills, and have a systematic approach to
          problem-solving.<br /><br />

          While I have worked in leadership positions, I am always eager to
          learn from experts in their field.<br /><br />
