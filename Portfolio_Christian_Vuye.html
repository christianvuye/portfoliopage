                    <h2>About me</h2>
                        <h3>Hi there!</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                        I'm a <strong> Junior Python developer </strong> with a background in game development. 
                        My first programming experience was when I worked as a technical designer scripting the mission flow for a Fast and Furious Crossroads level.<br/><br/>
        
                        Later, I moved towards managerial roles, managing 20-30 people using agile frameworks such as <strong>Scrum and Kanban</strong>. As this role depended on repetitive, 
                        manual tasks, I developed tools to automate and improve these processes. <br/><br/>

                        I also founded VMC Fitness, a fitness company that provides English-speaking clients in Valencia with the highest quality evidence-based service.<br/><br/> 
            
                        I bootstrapped the company out of my apartment with little to no starting capital, and after ten months, its market value was €33,000. 
                        I eventually decided to sell complete ownership of the company to return to programming.<br/><br/>

                        I am currently developing my skills for creating <strong>web apps within the Django framework.</strong>  
                        I want to <strong>explore Python further for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence</strong> applications in the future.<br/><br/>

                        Irrespective of the industry or field that I am in, I am a passionate, hard-working, and incredibly curious individual with a relentless work ethic. <br/><br/>

                        I thrive under pressure, am a pro-active fast learner with strong communication skills, and have a systematic approach to problem-solving.<br/><br/>

                        While I have worked in leadership positions, I am always eager to learn from experts in their field.<br/><br/>
